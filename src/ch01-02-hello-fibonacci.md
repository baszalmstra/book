## Hello, fibonacci?

Most programming languages start off with a "Hello, world!" example, but not
Mun. Mun is designed around the concept of hot reloading. Our philosophy is to
only add new language constructs when those can be hot reloaded. Since the first
building blocks of Mun were native types and functions our divergent example has
become fibonacci, hence "Hello, fibonacci?".

### Creating a Project Directory

The Mun compiler is agnostic to the location of a project directory, as long as
all source files are in the same place. Let's open a terminal to create our
first project directory:

```bash
mkdir hello_fibonacci
cd hello_fibonacci
```

### Writing and Running a Mun Library

Next, make a new source file and call it *hello_fibonacci.mun*. Mun files always
end with the *.mun extension*. If your file name consists of multiple words,
separate them using underscores.

Open up the new source file and enter the code in Listing 1-1.

Filename: hello_fibonacci.mun

<!-- HACK: Add an extension to support hiding of Mun code -->
```mun  
{{#include ../listings/ch01-getting-started/listing01.mun}}
```

<span class="caption">Listing 1-1: A function that calculates a fibonacci number</span>

Save the file and go back to your terminal window. You are now ready to compile
your first Mun library. Enter the following command to compile the file:

```bash
mun build hello_fibonacci.mun
```

Contrary to many other languages, Mun doesn't support standalone applications,
instead it is shipped in the form of Mun libraries - recognisable by their
`*.munlib` extension. That's why Mun comes with a command-line interface (CLI)
that can both compile and run Mun libraries. To run a Mun library, enter the
following command:

```bash
mun start hello_fibonacci.munlib --entry fibonacci_n
```

The result of `fibonacci_n` (i.e. `5`) should now appear in your terminal.
Congratulations! You just successfully created and ran your first Mun library.

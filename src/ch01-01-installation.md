## Installation

First we need to install the Mun CLI (command-line interface), which acts as an
all-in-one tool for Mun application development. Pre-built binaries are
[available](https://github.com/mun-lang/mun/releases) for macOS, Linux, and
Windows (64-bit only). Download and extract the binaries to a location of your
preference.

You are now ready to write your first Mun code!
